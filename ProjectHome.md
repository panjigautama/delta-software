# DELTA: Delta Encoding for Less Traffic in Android #

---


We use delta encoding algorithms to reduce the size of Android app updates. We implement delta encoding for Android using the bsdiff and bspatch tools. Server software and an Android app have been developed. Currently, we are able to achieve 50% reduction in size for Android updates. If widely deployed, this has the potential to significantly reduce data traffic in cellular networks.
